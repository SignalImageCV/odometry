abstract = {An efficient algorithmic solution to the classical five-point relative pose problem is presented. The problem is to find the possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm well-suited for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-and-test framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been demonstrated at major conferences.},

abstract = {Today, visual recognition systems are still rarely employed in robotics applications. Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo, optical flow, visual odometry/SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {Where feature points are used in real-time frame-rate applications, a high-speed feature detector is necessary. Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7{\%} of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120{\%}) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300{\%}) can operate at full frame rate. Clearly a high-speed detector is of limited use if the features produced are unsuitable for downstream processing. In particular, the same scene viewed from two different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations [1]. Hence the second contribution of this paper is a comparison corner detectors based on this criterion applied to 3D scenes. This comparison supports a number of claims made elsewhere concerning existing corner detectors. Further, contrary to our initial expectations, we show that despite being principally constructed for speed, our detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors according to this criterion.},

abstract = {The Stanford Al Lab cart is a card-table sized mobile robot controlled remotely through a radio link, and equipped with a TV camera and transmitter. A computer has been programmed to drive the cart through cluttered indoor and outdoor spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by the onboard TV system. The cart uses several kinds of stereo to locate objects around it in 3D and to deduce its own motion. It plans an obstacle avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changes as the cart perceives new obstacles on its journey . The system is reliable for short runs, but slow. The cart moves one meter every ten to fifteen minutes, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stops, takes some pictures and thinks about them for a long time. Then it plans a new path, executes a little of it, and pauses again. The program has successfully driven the cart through several 20 meter indoor courses (each taking about five hours) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves. A less successful outdoor run, in which the cart skirted two obstacles but collided with a third, was also done. Harsh lighting (very bright surfaces next to very dark shadows) giving poor pictures and movement of shadows during the cart's creeping progress were major reasons for the poorer outdoor performance. The action portions of these runs were filmed by computer controlled cameras.},

This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

abstract = {Visual odometry is one of the most active topics in computer vision. The automotive industry is particularly interested in this field due to the appeal of achieving a high degree of accuracy with inexpensive sensors such as cameras. The best results on this task are currently achieved by systems based on a calibrated stereo camera rig, whereas monocular systems are generally lagging behind in terms of performance. We hypothesise that this is due to stereo visual odometry being an inherently easier problem, rather than than due to higher quality of the state of the art stereo based algorithms. Under this hypothesis, techniques developed for monocular visual odometry systems would be, in general, more refined and robust since they have to deal with an intrinsically more difficult problem. In this work we present a novel stereo visual odometry system for automotive applications based on advanced monocular techniques. We show that the generalization of these techniques to the stereo case result in a significant improvement of the robustness and accuracy of stereo based visual odometry. We support our claims by the system results on the well known KITTI benchmark, achieving the top rank for visual only systems},

abstract = {Robust navigation for mobile robots over long distances requires an accurate method for tracking the robot position in the environment. Promising techniques for position estimation by determining the camera ego-motion from monocular or stereo sequences have been previously described. However, long-distance navigation requires both a high level of robustness and a low rate of error growth. In this paper, we describe a methodology for long-distance rover navigation that meets these goals using robust estimation of ego-motion. The basic method is a maximum-likelihood ego-motion algorithm that models the error in stereo matching as a normal distribution elongated along the (parallel) camera viewing axes. Several mechanisms are described for improving navigation robustness in the context of this methodology. In addition, we show that a system based on only camera ego-motion estimates will accumulate errors with super-linear growth in the distance traveled, owing to increasing orientation errors. When an absolute orientation sensor is incorporated, the error growth can be reduced to a linear function of the distance traveled. We have tested these techniques using both extensive simulation and hundreds of real rover images and have achieved a low, linear rate of error growth. This method has been implemented to run on-board a prototype Mars rover. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proposed method addresses a basic problem of standard ICP, i.e. its inability to perform the segmentation of data points and to deal with large displacements. Neither a-priori knowledge of the motion nor inputs from other sensors are required, while the only assumption is that the scene always contains visually distinctive features which can be tracked over subsequent stereo pairs. This generates what is usually called Visual Odometry.

abstract = {Accurate 3d perception from video sequences is a core subject in computer vision and robotics, since it forms the basis of subsequent scene analysis. In practice however, online requirements often severely limit the utilizable camera resolution and hence also reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, real-time systems often rely on heavy parallelism which can prevent applications in mobile devices or driver assistance systems, especially in cases where FPGAs cannot be employed. This paper proposes a novel approach to build 3d maps from high-resolution stereo sequences in real-time. Inspired by recent progress in stereo matching, we propose a sparse feature matcher in conjunction with an efficient and robust visual odometry algorithm. Our reconstruction pipeline combines both techniques with efficient stereo matching and a multi-view linking scheme for generating consistent 3d point clouds. In our experiments we show that the proposed odometry method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Including feature matching, the visual odometry part of our algorithm runs at 25 frames per second, while - at the same time - we obtain new depth maps at 3-4 fps, sufficient for online 3d reconstructions.},

This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps.

abstract = {Visual odometry (VO) is the process of estimating the egomotion of an agent (e.g., vehicle, human, and robot) using only the input of a single or If multiple cameras attached to it. Application domains include robotics, wearable computing, augmented reality, and automotive. The term VO was coined in 2004 by Nister in his landmark paper. The term was chosen for its similarity to wheel odometry, which incrementally estimates the motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time. Likewise, VO operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras. For VO to work effectively, there should be sufficient illumination in the environment and a static scene with enough texture to allow apparent motion to be extracted. Furthermore, consecutive frames should be captured by ensuring that they have sufficient scene overlap.},

abstract = {This paper is a survey of the theory and methods of photogrammetric bundle adjustment, aimed at potential implementors in the computer vision community. Bundle adjustment is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to produce jointly optimal structure and viewing pa- rameter estimates. Topics covered include: the choice of cost function and robustness; numerical optimization including sparse Newton methods, linearly convergent approximations, updating and recursive methods; gauge (datum) invariance; and quality control. The theory is developed for general robust cost functions rather than restricting attention to traditional nonlinear least squares. Keywords:},
